           <h3>Ingredients</h3>
           <ul>
               <li>1 large onion, cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>
               <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
               <li>1 teaspoons baking powder</li>
               <li>1 teaspoons salt</li>
               <li>1 egg</li>
               <li>1 cups milk, or as needed</li>
               <li>¾ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
               <li>seasoned salt to taste</li>
               <li>2 tablespoons oil for frying, or as needed</li>
           </ul><hr>

           <h3>Cooking instructions</h3>
           <ol>
               <li>Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li><br>
               <li>Separate the onion slices into rings, and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt.</li><br>
               <li>Dip the onion slices into the flour mixture until they are all coated; set aside.<br>
                   Whisk the egg and milk into the flour mixture using a fork. Dip the floured rings into the batter to coat,<br>
                   then place on a wire rack to drain until the batter stops dripping. Spread the bread crumbs out on a plate or shallow dish.<br>
                   Place rings one at a time into the crumbs,
                   and scoop the crumbs up over the ring to coat.<br>
                   The coating should cling very well. Repeat with remaining rings.</li>
               <li>Deep fry the rings a few at a time for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown.<br>
                   Remove to paper towels to drain. Season with seasoning salt, and serve.</li>
