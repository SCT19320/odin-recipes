        <h1>Thai style curry</h3>
            <p>This fragrant curry is inspired by Southern Thai cuisine. You'll make a punchy panang-style sauce with chicken,<br> 
                peanut butter, coconut and red curry paste, then serve with rice and crispy onions.</p>

        <h3>Cooking instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the basmati rice and 300ml [600ml] cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat<br>
                Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed <br>and the rice is cooked                
                Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving.</li><br>
            <li>Meanwhile, take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it breathe before cooking.<br>
                Peel and finely slice the brown onion               
                Deseed the red pepper and cut into thin strips.</li><br>
            <li>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat.<br>
                Once hot, add the sliced onion and pepper strips and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften.</li><br>
            <li>At this point, we recommend that you boil half a kettle of water. Then,
                chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!).</li><br>
            <li>Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and smooth peanut butter in 250ml boiled water.<br>
                Add the ground turmeric, fish sauce, lime leaves and 1 tsp sugar this is your peanut stock.</li><br>
            <li>Cut the chicken breast portions into small bite-sized pieces.<br>
                Once the pepper and onion has softened, add the chopped chicken and Thai red curry paste to the pan <br>and cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant.</li><br>
            <li>Once fragrant, add the peanut stock and cook for 7-8 min further or until the chicken is cooked through<br> 
                (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened.</li>
