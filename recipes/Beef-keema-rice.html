        <h3>Cooking instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and finely slice the brown onion, then Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid)<br>
                with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar <br>and cook for 3 min,
                or until starting to soften, then add the beef mince and cook for a further 3 min.</li><br>
            <li>Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and chop the carrots into small, bite-sized pieces.<br> 
                Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate (or finely chop) the ginger.<br>
                Peel and grate (or finely chop) the garlic</li><br>
            <li>Add the chopped carrot, grated ginger and grated garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min.</li><br>
            <li>Add the beef stock mix, tomato paste and curry powder and give everything a good mix up.</li><br>
            <li>Stir the basmati rice into the pan.</li><br>
            <li>Add 300ml [600ml] cold water to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat.<br>
                Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked.<br>
                Check and stir occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom.</li><br>
            <li>Meanwhile, cut the lime[s] in half and Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)<br>                
                Stir the chopped coriander and juice of 1/2 lime through the cooked rice.<br>            
                Serve the beef keema in bowls and garnish with a sprinkle of the reserved coriander leaves and a lime wedge to the side.</li><br>
            <li>This is your beef keema. Enjoy!</li>
