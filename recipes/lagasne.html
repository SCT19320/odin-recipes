        <h3>Cooking instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to160C/325F/Gas 3.</li> <br>
            <li>For the ragu, heat a large frying pan until hot and add the oil. 
                Cook the mince until browned all over. <br>
                Remove from the heat and transfer to a plate. 
                Add the onion, celery (if using) and garlic to <br>the pan and cook until softened. 
                Return the meat to the pan and stir in the flour. Add the stock and bring to the boil.<br>
                Add the redcurrant jelly (or sugar), tomato purée and thyme, then stir well.</li> <br>
            <li>Stir in the canned tomatoes. Bring to the boil again, cover and simmer in the oven for 1-½ hours, or until the beef is tender.</li> <br>
            <li>For the white sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the flour and cook over the heat for one minute. <br>
                Gradually whisk in the hot milk, whisking until thickened. 
                Add the Dijon mustard and<br> parmesan cheese and season well with salt and pepper.</li> <br>
            <li>For the lasagne, put one third of the meat sauce in the base of a 2.3 litre/4 pint shallow ovenproof dish. <br>
                Spoon one third of the white sauce on top. Arrange one layer of lasagne sheets on top and Season. <br>
                Spoon half of the remaining meat sauce on top and then half of the white sauce. 
                Put another layer of lasagne sheets on top,<br>then the remaining meat sauce and remaining white sauce. 
                Sprinkle over the cheddar cheese.</li> <br>
            <li>Leave for six hours before cooking so that the pasta can start to soften.</li> <br>
            <li>Preheat the oven temperature to 200C/400F/Gas 6. </li> <br>
            <li>Cook in the middle of the oven for about 45 minutes- or until golden brown on top, bubbling around the edges and the pasta is soft.</li><br>
            <li>This is your Lasagne. Enjoy!</li>
